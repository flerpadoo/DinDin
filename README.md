Just a simple script to watch the network for a given MAC address. It's not terribly impressive, but it works.

I am currently testing out some features suggested by other people:
* Watch local ARP cache instead of tcpdump output
* Use local for email instead of an SMTP server
* Arguments to switch between these options

Please feel free to recommend any other features, but please keep in mind that I'm not taking this tool too seriously.
